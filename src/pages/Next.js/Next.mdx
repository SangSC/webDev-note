# Syntax Highlighting

Nextra uses [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io) to do syntax highlighting at build
time. It's very reliable and performant. For example, adding this in your
Markdown file:

````md filename="Markdown"
```js
console.log("hello, world");
```
````

Results in:

```js
console.log("hello, world");
```

## Features

### Inlined Code

Inlined syntax highlighting like `let x = 1{:jsx}` is also supported via the
`{:}` syntax:

```md filename="Markdown"
Inlined syntax highlighting is also supported `let x = 1{:jsx}` via:
```

### Highlighting Lines

You can highlight specific lines of code by adding a `{}` attribute to the code
block:

````md filename="Markdown"
```js {1,4-5}
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```
````
